This is a general purpose library for unit conversion used in production on
https://www.cinc.kitchen. It's primary purpose has been to  make conversion of 
units straightforward. Because it has been built with recipes in mind, many 
unit systems unrelated to cooking are not yet included. Contributions are
welcome.
