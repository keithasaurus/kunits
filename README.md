This is a general purpose library for unit conversion, which is used in production on
https://www.cinc.kitchen. It's primary purpose is to  make conversion of 
measurements straightforward and accurate. Because it was first built with recipes in mind, 
many  unit systems unrelated to cooking are not yet included. Contributions are
welcome.
